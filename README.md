### AWS Lambda vs Azure Functions
### "- _Greetings Professor Function. How about a nice game of Tic-Tac-Func?_"

Play the game at: https://davidvujic.github.io/tictacfunc

This repo is the user interface part of Tic-Tac-Func: static client script, html, images and css files. The javascript code consumes a back end service hosted in a different domain, using jsonp calls.

Have a look at the back end repository: https://github.com/DavidVujic/tictacfunc-backend

Also, the players repo, where the source code for AWS Lambda and Azure Functions is: https://github.com/DavidVujic/tictacfunc-player
